I joined a new bookclub that's reading ["The Coding Career Handbook"](https://learninpublic.org/) by Shawn Wang (@swyx). We'll be jumping around chapters a bit, since the book wasn't intended to be read in order, per the author's advice. Here's my notes on each chapter we've covered.

## Chapter 5: From Junior to Senior

- "A senior title with the pay is meaningless!" 👏 👏 👏
- ["The Difficulty Anchor" by Mekka Okereke](https://twitter.com/mekkaokereke/status/1027552576454021120)
  - Research shows most marginalized groups will leave their job frustrated with rate of promotion or perception of being evaluated unfairly
  - Don't listen to people who say "don't worry about performance reviews". Those folks are probably in a more privileged position.
  - "Just do good work" isn't going to be enough
  - Typical sequence of events:
      > 1) People think that you are not that good. 🤬
      > 2) You do good work, and accomplish something impressive! You showed them! 😃
      > 3) But peers retroactively downgrade the value of that accomplishment! 😮
  - Post-fact devaluing: "For your peer, the shortest mental path back to consistency is often to devalue your work."
  - How to counter this?
      1. Before project starts, find a Very Smart Person with strong organizational credibility. Explain your plan to them in great detail.
      2. During project: do great work and keep detailed notes.
      3. After project: publically celebrate your work and make sure your Very Smart Person chimes in to validate you and squash all the haters.
- Comparisons:
  - "Juniors get code working. Seniors keep code working."
  - "Seniors create tooling to preclude bugs."
  - "Juniors learn to find the right answers. Seniors learn to ask the right questions."
  - "Juniors should say “Yes” often. Seniors should say “No” more."

## Chapter 6: Senior Developer

- "Done is better than perfect"
- "Good enough is better than best"
- Prudent vs Reckless technical debt
  - Prudent
    - Outdated
    - Makes money
  - Reckless
    - Taking shortcuts, cutting corners
    - Meant to speed up development, but eventually slows you down
    - Results in loss of predictability
    - Adding resources increases risk
- Sell tech debt as risk instead when talking to LT
