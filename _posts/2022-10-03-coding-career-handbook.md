I joined a new bookclub that's reading ["The Coding Career Handbook"](https://learninpublic.org/) by Shawn Wang (@swyx). We'll be jumping around chapters a bit, since the book wasn't intended to be read in order, per the author's advice. Here's my notes on each chapter we've covered.

## Chapter 5: From Junior to Senior

- "A senior title with the pay is meaningless!" üëè üëè üëè
- ["The Difficulty Anchor" by Mekka Okereke](https://twitter.com/mekkaokereke/status/1027552576454021120)
  - Research shows most marginalized groups will leave their job frustrated with rate of promotion or perception of being evaluated unfairly
  - Don't listen to people who say "don't worry about performance reviews". Those folks are probably in a more privileged position.
  - "Just do good work" isn't going to be enough
  - Typical sequence of events:
      > 1) People think that you are not that good. ü§¨
      > 2) You do good work, and accomplish something impressive! You showed them! üòÉ
      > 3) But peers retroactively downgrade the value of that accomplishment! üòÆ
  - Post-fact devaluing: "For your peer, the shortest mental path back to consistency is often to devalue your work."
  - How to counter this?
      1. Before project starts, find a Very Smart Person with strong organizational credibility. Explain your plan to them in great detail.
      2. During project: do great work and keep detailed notes.
      3. After project: publically celebrate your work and make sure your Very Smart Person chimes in to validate you and squash all the haters.
- Comparisons:
  - "Juniors get code working. Seniors keep code working."
  - "Seniors create tooling to preclude bugs."
  - "Juniors learn to find the right answers. Seniors learn to ask the right questions."
  - "Juniors should say ‚ÄúYes‚Äù often. Seniors should say ‚ÄúNo‚Äù more."

## Chapter 6: Senior Developer

- "Done is better than perfect"
- "Good enough is better than best"
- Prudent vs Reckless technical debt
  - Prudent
    - Outdated
    - Makes money
  - Reckless
    - Taking shortcuts, cutting corners
    - Meant to speed up development, but eventually slows you down
    - Results in loss of predictability
    - Adding resources increases risk
- Sell tech debt as risk instead when talking to LT

### Group discussion

- Linked blog posts
  - "Tech debt" isn't a good parallel to financial debt, because you're not really paying it down or anything like that
  - Better to reframe it as risk
- Rewriting
  - Decision to rewrite in new language, framework etc is tricky
  - If you go with greenfield rewrite, how long do you live maintaining two systems? What about bugs in the old one?
- Mentorship, Sponsorship, Allyship
  - People might not welcome an offer of mentorship, but no one turns down sponsorship
  - Antipattern: taking all the good work yourself, so everyone else is stuck with no opportunities to grow
  - Invite juniors into meetings/conversations with more experienced folks so they can "be in the room"
- Business impact
  - Foolproof way to show biz impact
    - Find someone who uses your product
    - Ask them to speak up about something they want added/fixed
    - Add/fix it
  - Recommendation: [Dream Machines](http://worrydream.com/refs/Nelson-ComputerLibDreamMachines1975.pdf) by Ted Nelson
