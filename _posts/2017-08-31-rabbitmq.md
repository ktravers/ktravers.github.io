A code reading by [@joshrowley](https://github.com/joshrowley), part 1.

# Concepts

## Fuzzy overview of stuff we've heard about [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/)

- Written in Erlang
- Queues, Exchanges, Channels, Subscriptions
- Publishers, Consumers
- Connections
- Fanouts
- Self-healing
- Distributed

## Actual overview

- **Message broker** originally built by JPMorgan Chase. Built 2004, released 2007.
- Designed as a way to solve problems with integration points between many different bank systems. Needed standardized way of sending messages between apps.
- Goals: reliability, guaranteed message delivery between apps, uptime
- Solution: AMQP (protocol)

### What is AMQP?

- Runs on Erlang OTP
- Queues where you persist messages
- Consumers who consume messages
- Acks inform queue when message is processed
- Whole thing ensures streams of data are processed as intended
- Any client can use AMQP, so why roll your own?
- Decouples publishers from consumers

```
Producer - app that publishes messages (Ironbroker, Ironboard, Flatchat)

|
|  -  TCP Connection (ongoing 2-way connection)
V

Broker (RabbitMQ)  
  - Queues ("mailboxes"): hold messages, wait for consumer to connect and take message off queue, load balances
  - Exchanges: publishers publish message to exchange, exchange routes to queue(s)
  - Bindings: rules you define for how exchanges publish messages to queues
  - Connections: can be multi-plexed into multiple channels

|
|  -  TCP Connection (ongoing 2-way connection)
V

Consumer - app that receives messages (Ironworker, Sneakers)
```

### Our Publishers
- Ironbroker
- Ironboard
- Flatchat

### Our Consumers
- Ironworker
- Sneakers


### Direct vs Fanout Exchanges

Direct exchange: routes based on routing key

Fanout exchange: routing keys DON'T MATTER, publishes out to all queues (broadcast)

```
Publisher
   |
   |
   V
Exchange
|  |  |
|  |  |
V  V  V
Q  Q  Q
```

Fanout use cases:  
- financial brokers, ex. stock price event, broadcast to all consumers
- event sourcing in micro-service architecture


# Code

[Sneakers](https://github.com/jondot/sneakers) (aka our "workers") uses a gem called [Bunny gem](https://github.com/ruby-amqp/bunny).

```ruby
# connect to rabbit with default settings
conn = Bunny.new
conn.start

# create channel on the connection
# channels are a way for a TCP connection (expensive) to be shared in a lightweight way
channel = conn.create_channel

# create queue
# consumers get messages from queues
queue = channel.queue('hello_world', auto_delete: true)

# subscribe to queue
# the rabbitmq server will push messages down the channel when the queue receives messages
queue.subscribe do |delivery_info, metadata, payload|
  puts "queue #{queue.name} received message payload: #{payload}"
end

# create exchange using the default exchange
exchange = channel.default_exchange

# when not using default exhange, would need to bind queue to exchange
# queue = channel.queue('hello_world')
# queue.bind(non_default_exchange, routing_key: 'cool key')

# send some messages
while true
  payload = "Hello World!"

  # by default, AMQP uses queue names for routing keys
  routing_key = queue.name
  exchange.publish(payload, routing_key: routing_key)
  puts "publishing to the default exchnage with routing key #{routing_key} and message payload: #{payload}"
  sleep 1
end
```

# Day to Day Usage

- Sneakers
- Ironbroker - translate HTTP to AMQP (publisher)
