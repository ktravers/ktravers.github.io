title: 2021 Brag Document
tags: [career]
---

I published my first ever ["brag doc"]({% post_url 2020-09-17-brag-doc %}) last year (inspired by Julia Evans' post ["Get your work recognized: write a brag document"](https://jvns.ca/blog/brag-documents)), and just like Julia promised, it was a super helpful tool when it came time for year-end reviews (and for self-reflection in general).

So here we go again! I'm using [Julia's template](https://jvns.ca/blog/brag-documents/#template) agian and will be updating this continuously through the rest of the calendar year.

## Goals for this year

<!--
List your major goals here! Sharing your goals with your manager & coworkers is really nice because it helps them see how they can support you in accomplishing those goals!
-->

- Lead a feature team
- Develop a new conference talk (carried over from [last year]({% post_url 2020-09-17-brag-doc %}))

## Goals for next year

<!--
If it's getting towards the end of the year, maybe start writing down what you think your goals for next year might be.
-->

- Deliver a new conference talk

## Projects

<!--
For each one, go through:

- What your contributions were (did you come up with the design? Which components did you build? Was there some useful insight like "wait, we can cut scope and do what we want by doing way less work" that you came up with?)
- The impact of the project - who was it for? Are there numbers you can attach to it? (saved X dollars? shipped new feature that has helped sell Y big deals? Improved performance by X%? Used by X internal users every day?). Did it support some important non-numeric company goal (required to pass an audit? helped retain an important user?)

Remember: don't forget to explain what the results of you work actually were! It's often important to go back a few months later and fill in what actually happened after you launched the project.
-->

- Working on high visibility company-wide iniative to improve core performance metrics


### Collaboration & mentorship

<!--
Examples of things in this category:

- Helping others in an area you're an expert in (like "other engineers regularly ask me for one-off help solving weird bugs in their CSS" or "quoting from the C standard at just the right moment")
- Mentoring interns / helping new team members get started
- Writing really clear emails/meeting notes
- Foundational code that other people built on top of
- Improving monitoring / dashboards / on call
- Any code review that you spent a particularly long time on / that you think was especially important
- Important questions you answered ("helped Risha from OTHER_TEAM with a lot of questions related to Y")
- Mentoring someone on a project ("gave Ben advice from time to time on leading his first big project")
- Giving an internal talk or workshop
-->

- Volunteered as an Adacats mentor (and mentee! Best of both worlds ðŸ™Œ)
- Volunteered on Adacats professional development panel "How to Make the Most Out of Manager 1:1s"


## Design & documentation

<!--
List design docs & documentation that you worked on

Design docs: I usually just say "wrote design for X" or "reviewed design for X"

Documentation: maybe briefly explain the goal behind this documentation (for example "we were getting a lot of questions about X, so I documented it and now we can answer the questions more quickly")
-->


## Company building

<!--
This is a category we have at work - it basically means "things you did to help the company overall, not just your project / team". Some things that go in here:

- Going above & beyond with interviewing or recruiting (doing campus recruiting, etc)
- Improving important processes, like the interview process or writing better onboarding materials
-->

- Served on Adacats leadership team

## What you learned

<!--
Try listing important things you learned or skills you've acquired recently! Some examples of skills you might be learning or improving:

- how to do performance analysis & make code run faster
internals of an important piece of software (like the JVM or Postgres or Linux)
- how to use a library (like React)
- how to use an important tool (like the command line or Firefox dev tools)
- about a specific area of programming (like localization or timezones)
- an area like product management / UX design
- how to write a clear design doc
- a new programming language

It's really easy to lose track of what skills you're learning, and usually when I reflect on this I realize I learned a lot more than I thought and also notice things that I'm not learning that I wish I was.
-->

- Learned how to use performance analysis tools like [flamegraph](https://github.com/brendangregg/FlameGraph), [speedscope](https://github.com/jlfwong/speedscope)
- Leveled up my DataDog dashboard game


## Outside of work

<!--
It's also often useful to track accomplishments outside of work, like:

- blog posts
- talks/panels
- open source work
- Industry recognition
-->

- Volunteered with [Code Nation](https://codenation.org/volunteers/) teaching teaching web development to high school students from underserved communities in NYC for the 2020-21 school year
