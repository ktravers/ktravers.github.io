Everything I learned about landing a great job in tech I learned from our ridiculously awesome career services team at Flatiron School. Obviously I'm biased, but seriously... they're demonstrably the best in the biz. I attached their handbook on being a "no-brainer" hire. I think the most important parts are 1) blogging - maintain a technical blog and share it with potential employers, 2) side projects - always be building, so you have cool stuff to show employers and 3) find your people - keep going to Meetups, consider presenting at one or two, just keep getting out there in your local tech scene.

My co-worker Sophie also just started a really great newsletter on landing your first tech job (and thriving there): https://www.break-in.tech/. I'd recommend checking the [interviewing](https://www.break-in.tech/?category=interviewing) and [junior dev](https://www.break-in.tech/?category=junior+dev) posts.

Code Newbie is another great community to get involved with. They've got a great podcast and super active Twitter chats. 

I love the Dev.to community as well. It's super supportive and full of cool people with great advice.

Plus please feel free to reach out to me with any questions as you continue on your job search. I'm happy to give job/role-specific advice, connect you with more people, or even do a mock technical interview - whatever'd be helpful for you.

Good luck and keep me posted!




As far as advice on the first job goes, in addition to the stuff I shared in my last email, my co-worker Tracy has a great post on what she learned from her first couple months on the job: https://medium.com/learn-love-code/9-ways-to-make-the-most-of-your-first-few-months-as-a-junior-developer-5c8234fb6403. We've been working together for almost three years now, and her advice is spot on.

First there's https://www.break-in.tech, which is run by my co-worker Sophie DeBenedetto (who also has an excellent technical blog). It has some great content on interviewing and leveling up as a junior dev.

Following up from our convo today, here's some good resources on leveling up career-wise and communication-wise.

One super long but super good article that covers both topics is this one, which Jonas sent me last year, by John Allspaw, former CTO at Etsy: https://www.kitchensoap.com/2012/10/25/on-being-a-senior-engineer/

That article sent me to some other good places on the internet, the two best of which were:

  - "Improve Your Communication Skills – Listening" http://katemats.com/improve-your-communication-skills-listening-being-awesome-part-3a/
