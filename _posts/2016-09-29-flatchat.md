Flatchat is our in-house replacement for Slack, which we'll be moving our users off soon.

## Stats

- maxing out at ~350-500 unique websockets
- avg 200ms room load time

Check `/pghero` for db query diagnostics.

ssh into flatchat server for [PM2 monitoring](http://pm2.keymetrics.io/docs/usage/monitoring/).
- logs are rolled over every 7 days
- `pm2 monit` for live resource usage
- `pm2 list` for quick summary

## Handling Message

1. Validate inputs (flatchatter and room member)
2. Check room policy
3. Write message to db
4. Add more stuff to message object (decorator?)
5. Broadcast msg
  - to other users in room
  - to other rooms
6. Send msg info to rabbitmq for processing


#### Details:

- Room stored in session
- User bounced if no access to room / no room
