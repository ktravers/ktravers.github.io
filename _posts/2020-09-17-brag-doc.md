title: 2020 Brag Document
---

I've been meaning to get around to keeping a "brag doc" ever since I read Julia Evans' excellent post on the subject, ["Get your work recognized: write a brag document"](https://jvns.ca/blog/brag-documents). September is a little late to start one for 2020, but hey, why put it off any longer?

I'm using [Julia's template](https://jvns.ca/blog/brag-documents/#template) and will be updating this continuously through the rest of the calendar year.


## Goals for this year

<!--
List your major goals here! Sharing your goals with your manager & coworkers is really nice because it helps them see how they can support you in accomplishing those goals!
-->

- âœ… Earn promotion to senior software engineer (big goal, but worth swinging for!)
- Develop a new conference talk

## Goals for next year

<!--
If it's getting towards the end of the year, maybe start writing down what you think your goals for next year might be.
-->

- Lead a feature
- Deliver a new conference talk

## Projects

<!--
For each one, go through:

- What your contributions were (did you come up with the design? Which components did you build? Was there some useful insight like "wait, we can cut scope and do what we want by doing way less work" that you came up with?)
- The impact of the project - who was it for? Are there numbers you can attach to it? (saved X dollars? shipped new feature that has helped sell Y big deals? Improved performance by X%? Used by X internal users every day?). Did it support some important non-numeric company goal (required to pass an audit? helped retain an important user?)

Remember: don't forget to explain what the results of you work actually were! It's often important to go back a few months later and fill in what actually happened after you launched the project.
-->

### Collaboration & mentorship

<!--
Examples of things in this category:

- Helping others in an area you're an expert in (like "other engineers regularly ask me for one-off help solving weird bugs in their CSS" or "quoting from the C standard at just the right moment")
- Mentoring interns / helping new team members get started
- Writing really clear emails/meeting notes
- Foundational code that other people built on top of
- Improving monitoring / dashboards / on call
- Any code review that you spent a particularly long time on / that you think was especially important
- Important questions you answered ("helped Risha from OTHER_TEAM with a lot of questions related to Y")
- Mentoring someone on a project ("gave Ben advice from time to time on leading his first big project")
- Giving an internal talk or workshop
-->

- Created [`ama` repo](https://github.com/ktravers/ama) as an easily searchable, publicly available alternative to email qs
- Signed up as an Adacats mentor (also signed up as a mentee! Best of both worlds ðŸ™Œ)
- Fine-tuned alerts for services owned by my team to make them less flappy and more meaningful for on-call responders


## Design & documentation

<!--
List design docs & documentation that you worked on

Design docs: I usually just say "wrote design for X" or "reviewed design for X"

Documentation: maybe briefly explain the goal behind this documentation (for example "we were getting a lot of questions about X, so I documented it and now we can answer the questions more quickly")
-->

- Added documenation for identifying and fixing orphaned repos

## Company building

<!--
This is a category we have at work - it basically means "things you did to help the company overall, not just your project / team". Some things that go in here:

- Going above & beyond with interviewing or recruiting (doing campus recruiting, etc)
- Improving important processes, like the interview process or writing better onboarding materials
-->

- Along with an impressive group of kind + determined friends, helped bring an awesome former co-worker to an awesome team at GitHub
- Asked a question in company-wide Q&A that got answered by our CEO (baby steps towards being more vocal in my new role)

## What you learned

<!--
Try listing important things you learned or skills you've acquired recently! Some examples of skills you might be learning or improving:

- how to do performance analysis & make code run faster
internals of an important piece of software (like the JVM or Postgres or Linux)
- how to use a library (like React)
- how to use an important tool (like the command line or Firefox dev tools)
- about a specific area of programming (like localization or timezones)
- an area like product management / UX design
- how to write a clear design doc
- a new programming language

It's really easy to lose track of what skills you're learning, and usually when I reflect on this I realize I learned a lot more than I thought and also notice things that I'm not learning that I wish I was.

## Outside of work

<!--
It's also often useful to track accomplishments outside of work, like:

- blog posts
- talks/panels
- open source work
- Industry recognition
-->

- Volunteered with [Venture for America (VFA)](https://ventureforamerica.org/) for the 4th year in a row, delivered "How to Work With Developers" talk as part of their summer training camp
- Volunteered as a guest judge for [Code Nations's Summer Tech Academy](https://codenation.org/spring-tech-academy/) final projects
- Volunteered with [Code Nation](https://codenation.org/volunteers/) teaching web development to NYC high schoolers for the 2020-21 school year
