One of my preferred strategies for staying up to date in tech is newsletters. Call me old school, but I love a good email newsletter. A curated list of recommended blog posts, talks, and career opportunties delivered directly to my inbox? Yes please, much appreciated. I'm subscribed to a ton of them, and I've found them immensely helpful for staying on top of things.

Which isn't to say I read all of them right away (c'mon, I wish I had that kind of time). Most I'll just skim, maybe save a few links to read later, then archive away. Others I archive instantly, leveraging inbox filters to make sure everything's sorted and tagged for easy retrieval later. The result is my own automated archive of helpful resources, stored safely away in my inbox. When I'm researching something new or looking for inspiration, it's the first place I look.

Below are a few of my favorites. I hope they're as helpful for you as they have been for me. I'm always looking for new recommendations, so be sure to leave your faves in the comments!


### _General_

#### [A List Apart](https://alistapart.com/email-signup/) from [L. Jeffrey Zeldman et al.](https://alistapart.com/about/masthead/)

_"A List Apart explores the design, development, and meaning of web content, with a special focus on web standards and best practices."_ One of the most long-standing, well-respected magazines in the field. An invaluable resource for thoughtful, insightful, and resonant writing. If you're looking to improve your own technical writing, I also recommend their [style guide](https://alistapart.com/about/style-guide/).

#### [Increment](https://increment.com/about/#newsletter) from [Stripe](https://stripe.com/)

_"Increment is a print and digital magazine about how teams build and operate software systems at scale."_ A glossy newsletter that's also available in [print form](https://store.increment.com/). Impeccably crafted in every sense, it offers monthly issues organized around a single them, like "APIs" or "Open Source", with contributions from some of the biggest names in the industry.

[Example](https://increment.com/security/)

#### [Pointer.io](http://www.pointer.io/) from [Suraj Kapoor](http://www.pointer.io/about-me/)

_"Pointer is a reading club for developers. It's a window into what other current and future CTOs are reading and thinking about. Super high quality engineering-related content, not just trendy topics or link bait."_ So incredibly well-curated, I end up reading or saving almost every link in every issue. If I could only subscribe to one tech newsletter, it'd be this one, no joke.

[Example](http://www.pointer.io/archives/a734ed7df3/)

#### [Assaf's Weekend Reading](https://assaf.substack.com/) from [Assaf Arkin](https://assaf.substack.com/about)

_"Once a week, in your inbox, the top links about software design and development, people and management, culture and technology. A mix of insightful and funny. Goes great with coffee. ‚òïÔ∏è"_ This one I usually read right away, start to finish, as soon as it lands in my inbox. It's an absolute delight, as promised. I also enjoy that it includes spicy and/or hilarious tweets from the non-obnoxious part of tech Twitter.

[Example](https://assaf.substack.com/p/weekend-reading-battery-down-to-90)

#### [SIGAVDI](https://avdi.codes/sigavdi/) from [Avdi Grimm](https://avdi.codes/)

_"...handpicked links to interesting articles, talks, or resources; an update on what I've published lately; and some reflections at the intersection of software and life."_ Avdi Grimm's semi-regular newsletter. A nice glimpse into his personal reading/viewing/listening lists, along with some delicious food pics.

[Example](https://avdi.codes/sigavdi-86-fancy-ramen-edition/)

#### [LeadDev Originals](https://leaddev.com/#block-subscriptionblock) from [LeadDev](https://leaddev.com/about-leaddev)

_"Weekly words and voices on engineering leadership...[with] the latest advice and upcoming events from LeadDev.com to help you lead effective tech teams."_ Roundup of articles and upcoming events from LeadDev.com. They run a fantastic conference series, and I've been really impressed with the caliber of their blog content and talks as well.
