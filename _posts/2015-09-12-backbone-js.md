"When declaring a View, options, el, tagName, id and className may be defined as functions, if you want their values to be determined at runtime." [1](https://addyosmani.github.io/backbone-fundamentals/#views-1)

"Also note that when using add() on a collection, passing {merge: true} causes duplicate models to have their attributes merged in to the existing models, instead of being ignored."
