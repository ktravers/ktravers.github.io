title: Interview Prep Questions for Developers
tags: [interviews, career]
---

At the end of 2019, I started looking for a new software engineering job, something I hadn't done in almost five years. I'd been very involved with my previous company's hiring process, helping design our interview process and running dozens of interviews for engineering and product team candidates at every level and role, so I thought was ready to be on the other side of the table.

Welp, surprise surprise, turns out I was super rusty. After floundering through my first couple behavioral interviews, I realized I couldn't go into these things cold. I needed to put some work in.

To prep, I put together two lists of questions (compiled from these excellent [resources](#sources)) -- [ones for me to ask the interviewer](#questions-for-them) and [ones I'd expect to have to answer myself](#questions-for-you) -- and kept both lists in front of me to reference as needed during interviews. I wrote out short answers to all the "Questions for you" in advance, prepping a couple different examples for each, so I could choose one in the moment best suited for the role/team. I also made of a copy of the "Questions for them" for each company and took notes on their answers during the interview. Keeping track of all the different responses made it easier to compare and contrast these opportunities later, but also provide direct, specific feedback afterwards, including thank you notes ✨

I ended up putting more work into these questions than more purely technical prep (memorizing algorithms, etc). That might surprise you, but it unquestionably paid off. Having this Q&A at the ready enabled me to get the information I needed from each interviewer and have a fun conversation while doing so. And when it came time to make a decision, it was easy to compare notes and say yes to the right team.

Below are both lists. You'll notice that these questions aren't specific to any particular role, stack, or level. Rather, they're intended to be broadly applicable for anyone interviewing for a role on an engineering team -- at least give you a good starting point that you can refine and adapt to your specific situation. I hope they're as helpful for you as they were for me.
