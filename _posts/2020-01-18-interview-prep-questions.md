title: Interview Prep Questions
tags: [interviews, career]
---

New decade, new job. At the end of last year, I started looking for a new job, something I hadn't done in almost five years. I'd been very involved with my company's hiring process, helping design our technical interviews and running dozens of interviews for engineering and product team candidates at every level and role, so I thought was ready to be on the other side of the table.

Welp, to no one's surprise, turns out I was super rusty. After floundering through my first couple behavioral interviews, I realized I couldn't go into these things cold. I needed to put some work in.

To prep, I put together two lists of questions (compiled from these excellent [resources](#sources)) -- [one for my interviewer](#questions-for-them) and [one for me](#questions-for-you) -- and kept both lists in front of me to reference as needed during interviews. I wrote out short answers to all the "Questions for you" in advance, prepping a couple different examples for each, so I could choose one in the moment best suited for the role/team. I also made of a copy of the "Questions for them" for each company and took notes on their answers during the interview. Keeping track of all the different responses not only made it easier to compare and contrast these opportunities later, but also provide direct, specific feedback afterwards, including thank you notes âœ¨

I ended up putting more work into these questions than more purely technical prep (memorizing algorithms, etc), which might surprise you, but it unquestionably paid off. Having this Q&A at the ready enabled me to get the information I needed from each interviewer and have a lively, fun conversation while doing so. By the time I had a couple offers in hand, it was easy to compare notes and say yes to the right team.

Below are both lists. I hope they're as helpful for you as they were for me.
