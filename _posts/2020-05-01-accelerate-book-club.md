I'm reading ["Accelerate" by Jez Humble, Gene Kim, and Nicole Forsgren](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/accelerate/9781457191435/) along with some folks at work (including author Nicole Forsgren, Ph.D!) 

Here's my notes on each chapter.

## Part One: What We Found

### Chapter 1 - Accelerate

- "...our research shows that none of the following often-cited factors predicted performance: ...whether a change approval board (CAB) is implemented"
- Summary of leading indicators:
  - Continuous deployment: "46 times more frequent code deployments" (aka "tempo")
  - Well-scoped PRs: "440 times faster lead time from commit to deploy"
  - Easy rollbacks: "170 times faster mean time to recover from downtime" (aka "stability")
  - High confidence deploys: "5 times lower change failure rate (1/5 as likely for a change to fail)"

#### Questions

- The book mentions that a "change approval board" isn't an indicator of success, so is it an indicator of something else? A warning sign / red flag?
