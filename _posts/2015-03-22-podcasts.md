title: Listen Up - Tech Podcasts
---

Back in my former life as an art historian / art shipper, it wasn't enough to simply know about art. You had to know about _the other people_ who know about art - the key figures shaping the field, your peers working on the same stuff you were - that was just as critical as being able to recite off [Greek column types](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_order) or the core members of the [Arte Povera movement](http://www.moma.org/collection/theme.php?theme_id=10454) (which I can still do, thanks very much, humanities degrees).

Now that I'm joining this new realm of web development, I have a whole world of new people to get to know. Honestly, it's been one of my favorite parts so far; the Ruby world especially has so many weird,wonderful voices, it's been a blast reading up on and listening to the amazing cast of coders behind all these concepts I'm learning about. 

One invaluable resource in this process has, of course, been podcasts. I pretty much only listen to podcasts these days (mostly comedy, with a dash of NPR and PRX staples), so it seemed natural to turn there for my tech education as well. Below are some of my favorites I've found so far. Hit me up in the comments with more recommendations!

####[Giant Robots Smashing Into Other Giant Robots](http://giantrobots.fm/) 
Probably my favorite technical podcast. Hosted by Ben Orenstein of [thoughtbot](https://robots.thoughtbot.com/), every week they have a new developer guest on to chat about development, design, current products, and all the joys/frustrations therein. I feel like it's given me a real window into the actual world of a working web developer. Plus, every guest has been smart, entertaining, and FUNNY. I'd even go so far as to recommend this to _non-programmers_ - well, non-programmers who are fascinated by Rails development and/or tech consulting. Fave eps:  

+ **ep. 28 =>** [Farther, further, faster](http://giantrobots.fm/51) - 50 minutes with David Heinemeier Hansson.  
+ **ep. 51 =>** [I found a voice](http://giantrobots.fm/51) - Ben interviews Sandi Metz, Ruby Hero award winner.  
+ **ep. 53 =>** [Not everything needs to be extracted](http://giantrobots.fm/53) - Yehuda Katz and Tom Dale go deep on bootstrapping, designing APIs, why Javascript matters...so much good stuff.   
+ **ep. 84 =>** [The Bus Number (Harper Reed)](http://giantrobots.fm/84) - Harper Reed (former CTO of Obama For America) talks government & tech, "craziness", and healthcare.gov

####[The Bike Shed](http://bikeshed.fm/) 
Another [thoughtbot](https://robots.thoughtbot.com/) production, hosted by [Sean Griffin](https://twitter.com/sgrif) and [Derek Prior](https://twitter.com/derekprior), this podcast digs into the hows and whys of web development, discussing theory as it applies to actual projects they're working on day-to-day. Pretty charmingly, too - which is no small feat for a CS theory chat show. Some excellent eps:  

+ **ep. 1 =>** [Sandi & Derek's Rules](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-bike-shed/id935763119?mt=2), where "Sean and Derek discuss lessons learned from following Sandi Metz' rules on a project and the overall impact of rules on code."  
+ **ep. 7 =>** [At the Car Wash](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-bike-shed/id935763119?mt=2), where they get into trade shows, bug stomping, and good/bad method naming

####[TLDR](http://www.onthemedia.org/blogs/on-the-media/)
I got into this podcast when it was still hosted by [PJ Vogt](https://twitter.com/pjvogt) and [Alex Goldmund](https://twitter.com/agoldmund), who've since moved on to their new podcast [Reply All](http://gimletmedia.com/show/reply-all/) (see below). [Meredith Haggerty](https://twitter.com/manymanywords) has taken over the reins, and while the tone has changed a little, it's still the same thoughtful yet playful weekly investigations of a single fun/weird/fascinating internet topic.

+ **ep. 4 =>** [The Unicorn](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/tldr/id709617583?mt=2) - Alex discovers a mythical being: a thirty-something-year-old man who has never used the internet.

+ **ep. 45/46 =>** [Episode 45 Redux](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/tldr/id709617583?mt=2) - firey Vivek Wadhwa interview.

####[Reply All](http://gimletmedia.com/show/reply-all/)
[PJ Vogt](https://twitter.com/pjvogt) and [Alex Goldmund](https://twitter.com/agoldmund)'s new podcast is the Serial of tech podcasts, if Serial was a) funny b) about the internet and c) hosted by two charming smart dudes. You should listen for their ad reads alone; possibly the only podcast where I DON'T skip forward through the ads. Also possibly the only podcast where one of the hosts [mounted a musical Twitter campaign against his co-host](http://www.onthemedia.org/story/urgent-tldr-advisory-warning-ft-matt-farley/). All time faves:

+ **ep. 3 =>** [We Know What You Did](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/reply-all/id941907967?mt=2) - the story of Ethan Zuckerman, the man who invented the pop-up ad.
+ **ep. 12 =>** [Back End Trouble](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/reply-all/id941907967?mt=2) - To quote: "The entire internet decides to look at one famous butt at the same time. One man has to ensure that the website hosting Kardashian butt pictures doesn't crash. The sheer terror and joy of solving that problem."
+ **ep. 4 =>** [Follow the Money](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/reply-all/id941907967?mt=2) - writer Chiara Atik explores the finer arts of Venmo 'spying'
