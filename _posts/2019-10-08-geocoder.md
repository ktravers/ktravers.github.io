I was working on a project recently where we needed to track the location of bands on tour, and give fans a way to see which of their favorite bands were playing near them on any given night.




What didn't work:

  - Separate `locations` table associated to my model
  - lat and long lived on locations table, not my model

What worked:

  - lat and long fields on my model
  - stubbed address method that returns nil
  - when serializing model, `try(:distance)` for distance (not always available)
