Kate Travers is a fullstack web developer specializing in Rails, React, and Elixir applications. Before changing careers to ship code, she spent five years shipping fine art for the world's finest museums, galleries, and private collectors. She currently works at [GitHub](https://github.com), where she hubs all the code that's fit to git.

Outside work, Kate is an active volunteer, tutor, and technical speaker, as well as backup quarterback for the four-time-defending champions of Brooklyn's co-ed touch football league. So as a hacker, logistics expert, and athlete, she's basically three out of Ocean's 11. Get in touch if you're planning the ultimate heist.
